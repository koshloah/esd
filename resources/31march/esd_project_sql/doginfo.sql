When we brought Bindi in to treat her leg, she was aggressive like anything, growling at anyone who approaches, threatening to attack in fear. How things has changed. Bindi now enjoys going for walks, and enjoys the affection and company of the humans she has come to know. However, she is not good with toddlers, and would do well in a small family with no young children.', 'https://sosd.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Bindi.jpg', 'https://sosd.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Bindi3.jpg'),

As she was born and raised in shelter, shelter is the only place she feels safe in. Besides, in the first 3 years of her life, Skippy was never taken out for walks out of her kennel. In turn, she is terrified of rainy days, and displayed fear aggression in apartment-living, when we first sent her to an adopter. We hope that she will be adopted someday, but that would require lots of work from all members of the adopters family, to gain her trust, so that she feels safe in their company, despite being in a foreign place.', 'https://sosd.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_4180.jpg', 'https://sosd.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Skippy2.jpg'),
